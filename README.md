# FirebaseUI for Android â€” UI Bindings for Firebase

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android)

FirebaseUI is an open-source library for Android that allows you to
quickly connect common UI elements to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)
APIs like the Realtime Database or Firebase Authentication.

A compatible FirebaseUI client is also available for [iOS](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios).

## Installation

FirebaseUI is published as a collection of libraries separated by the
Firebase API they target. Each FirebaseUI library has a transitive
dependency on the appropriate Firebase SDK so there is no need to include
those separately in your app.

In your `app/build.gradle` file add a dependency on one of the FirebaseUI
libraries.

```groovy
dependencies {
    // FirebaseUI Database only
    compile 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-database:1.2.0'

    // FirebaseUI Auth only
    compile 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-auth:1.2.0'

    // FirebaseUI Storage only
    compile 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui-storage:1.2.0'

    // Single target that includes all FirebaseUI libraries above
    compile 'com.firebaseui:firebase-ui:1.2.0'
}
```

If you're including the `firebase-ui-auth` dependency, there's a little
[more setup](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/tree/master/auth#configuration)
required.

After the project is synchronized, we're ready to start using Firebase functionality in our app.

### Compatibility with Firebase / Google Play Services Libraries

FirebaseUI libraries have the following transitive dependencies on the Firebase SDK:
```
firebase-ui-auth
|--- com.google.firebase:firebase-auth
|--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth

firebase-ui-database
|--- com.google.firebase:firebase-database

firebase-ui-storage
|--- com.google.firebase:firebase-storage
```

Each version of FirebaseUI has dependency on a fixed version of these libraries, defined as the variable `firebase_version`
in `common/constants.gradle`.  If you are using any dependencies in your app of the form
`compile 'com.google.firebase:firebase-*:x.y.z'` or `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-*:x.y.z'`
you need to make sure that you use the same version that your chosen version of FirebaseUI requires.

For convenience, here are some examples:

| FirebaseUI Version | Firebase/Play Services Version |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1.2.0              | 10.2.0                         |
| 1.1.1              | 10.0.0 or 10.0.1               |
| 1.0.1              | 10.0.0 or 10.0.1               |
| 1.0.0              | 9.8.0                          |
| 0.6.2              | 9.8.0                          |
| 0.6.1              | 9.6.1                          |
| 0.6.0              | 9.6.0                          |
| 0.5.3              | 9.4.0                          |
| 0.4.4              | 9.4.0                          |
| 0.4.3              | 9.2.1                          |
| 0.4.2              | 9.2.0                          |
| 0.4.1              | 9.0.2                          |
| 0.4.0              | 9.0.0                          |

## Usage

  * [firebase-ui-database](database/README.md)
  * [firebase-ui-auth](auth/README.md)
  * [firebase-ui-storage](storage/README.md)

## Sample App

There is a sample app in the `app/` directory that demonstrates most
of the features of FirebaseUI. Load the project in Android Studio and
run it on your Android device to see a demonstration. 

Before you can run the sample app, you must create a project in
the Firebase console. Add an Android app to the project, and copy
the generated google-services.json file into the `app/` directory.
Also enable [anonymous authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/anonymous-auth)
for the Firebase project, since some components of the sample app
requires it.

If you encounter a version incompatibility error between Android Studio
and Gradle while trying to run the sample app, try disabling the Instant
Run feature of Android Studio. Alternatively, update Android Studio and
Gradle to their latest versions.
