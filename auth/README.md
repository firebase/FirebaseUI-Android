# FirebaseUI for Android â€” Auth

FirebaseUI Auth is an open-source library that offers simple,
customizable UI bindings on top of the core
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) SDKs. It aims to eliminate boilerplate
code and promote best practices (both user experience and security) for
authentication.

A simple API is provided for drop-in user authentication which handles
the flow of signing in users with Email/Password,
Google Sign-In, and Facebook Login. It is built on top of the
[Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).

The best practices embodied in FirebaseUI aim to maximize sign-in
and sign-up conversion for your app. It integrates with
[Smart Lock for Passwords](https://developers.google.com/identity/smartlock-passwords/android/)
to store and retrieve credentials, enabling automatic and single-tap sign-in to
your app for returning users. It also handles tricky use cases like
account recovery and account linking that are security sensitive and
difficult to implement correctly using the base APIs provided by Firebase Auth.

FirebaseUI auth can be easily customized to fit with the rest of your app's
visual style. As it is open source, you are also free to modify it to exactly
fit your preferred user experience.

Equivalent FirebaseUI auth libraries are also available for
[iOS](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-ios/)
and [Web](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web/).
